DSN Uniben Project: Week 1

Problem Statement.
The challenge is to simulate group stage matches for a tournament. You are provided with a list that contains several dictionaries. 
The dictionaries are used to hold the information of each team. It holds the Name, The Goal scored, and Goal conceived, the Goal difference, and the Points Accumulated.
The dictionary is the form; {"Name": "Team Name", "Pts": 0, "GS": 0, "GC": 0, "GD": 0}, Pts represent the points, GS for goal scored, GC for goal conceived while Goal difference is represented with GD.

Group match format
The teams are going to play against each other twice. The goals for each team are generated by a python randomization library; Random. The scores are random integers from 0 to 5 using the random library. 
For a match-up, The team with the highest score wins the match and gets three points, if it ends in a draw (Both teams have the same score), They both get a point each. The goal scored is added to GS and the goal conceived is added to GC while the goal difference is added to the winning team and subtracted from the losing team.
N.B goal difference is the goal scored minus the goal conceived (GS â€“ GC).
We already supplied an algorithm to sort the list by Points and Goal difference and print the result. 

Good Luck Data Ninjas!
